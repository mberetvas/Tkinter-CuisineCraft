[2025-07-25 12:25:20] - Started implementation: updating database and models for persistent week menu storage.
[2025-07-25 12:26:48] - Completed implementation of the manual week menu tab, including database schema updates, new data models, and GUI integration.
[2025-07-25 12:33:28] - Debugged and identified root cause for "no such table: WeekMenu" error: table creation was not guaranteed for existing databases. Planning fix to ensure table creation on every connection.
[2025-07-25 12:34:08] - Fixed "no such table: WeekMenu" error by ensuring `create_tables` is called on every database connection in `connect()` method. This guarantees all required tables are present even for existing databases.
[2025-07-25 12:35:37] - Error "no such table: WeekMenu" persists. Root cause may be multiple connections or timing of table creation. Planning to enforce table creation on every connection and consider a startup migration check.
[2025-07-25 12:36:05] - Consolidated all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements in `tkinter_gui/db.py` into a single `try` block to ensure all tables, including `WeekMenu`, are reliably created on database connection. This should resolve the "no such table" error.
